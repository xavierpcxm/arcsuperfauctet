I want to build an Arc Super Faucet, inspired by:
https://easyfaucetarc.xyz/

FIXED FAUCET CONTRACT (VERY IMPORTANT)

The faucet vault contract address is FIXED and MUST be used as the source of truth:

0x0dCA4156d4b138EbA6578B2e771297D80637B840


This contract:

Holds the USDC balance

Distributes the funds

Stores all user and global stats

The frontend must ONLY READ DATA FROM THIS CONTRACT.

FUNDAMENTAL RULE

NO DATA MAY DEPEND ON FRONTEND STATE.

No localStorage

No backend

No cached values

No inferred calculations

The Arc blockchain is the only source of truth.

NETWORK & TOKEN

Network: Arc Testnet

Token: USDC (6 decimals)

Claim amount: $500

Cooldown: 1 claim per wallet every 24 hours

BALANCE DISPLAY (CRITICAL)

Read the faucet balance using:

usdc.balanceOf(0x0dCA4156d4b138EbA6578B2e771297D80637B840)


Convert from 6 decimals

Display the value as $

✅ Example:

Onchain value: 2500000000

Display on site: $2,500

⚠️ Do NOT display “USDC”
⚠️ Do NOT calculate balance offchain

WALLET CONNECTION FLOW
Before Wallet Connection

Show message:

“Connect wallet to enable claiming”

Claim button must be disabled

After Wallet Connection

Enable all contract reads and display:

Connected wallet address

Available faucet balance: $X,XXX

Claim amount: $500

USER DATA (ONCHAIN)

Read directly from the contract:

Total claimed by this wallet

totalClaimedByUser(userAddress)

Display in $

Cooldown remaining

timeUntilNextClaim(userAddress)

Display as countdown HH:MM:SS

GLOBAL STATS (ONCHAIN – REAL TIME)

Always visible:

Total $ distributed

totalUSDCDistributed()

Total number of claims

totalClaims()

All values:

Pulled directly from the Arc blockchain

Refetched after every claim

CLAIM LOGIC

Read timeUntilNextClaim(userAddress)

If value == 0:

Enable button: “Claim $500”

If value > 0:

Disable button

Show:

“You can claim again in HH:MM:SS”

Countdown must:

Be derived from onchain timestamps

Update every second

Never rely on frontend memory

UX STATES

Wallet not connected → claim disabled

Wrong network → prompt switch to Arc Testnet

Faucet empty → show “Faucet empty”

Claim success → re-read ALL values from contract:

Faucet balance

User total claimed

Global distributed amount

Total claims

Cooldown timer

TECH CONSTRAINTS

Use ethers.js

Read-only calls for all stats

Send transaction only for claim()

Contract address hardcoded (or env, but fixed)

No backend

No APIs

No indexers

DESIGN

Minimal

Dark mode

Clear sections:

Faucet Balance

User Stats

Global Stats

Currency symbol: $

FINAL RESULT

A SuperFaucet where:

The displayed balance is the real onchain balance

All values are verifiable in the Arc explorer

The frontend cannot lie or desync

Users trust the system by design
